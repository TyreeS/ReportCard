# ReportCard
You have been contracted by Bequia S.D.A Primary School to create a program for them to use in producing report cards for their students.
You are required to input students’ first name, last name, gender, class, age, marks made in each subject (out of a hundred) and calculate the student’s report card.
The program will calculate on the report card the student’s overall percentage, their grade and depending on their percentage whether or not they will be promoted to the next class.
The subject being tested are: Mathematics, Grammar, Social Studies, Science and Creative Writing.
The program will then calculate the percentage overall for each student, their grade and determine where or not their promotion is at risk.
If the student’s age is equal or greater than 10 years then they will still be promoted even if their percentage is less than 50%.

The grading scheme is as follows:
A+  90 - 100
A   85 - 89
A-  80 - 84
B+  77 - 79
B   73 - 76
B-  70 - 72
C+  67 - 69
C   63 - 66
C-  60 - 62
D+  57 - 59
D   53 - 56
D-  50 - 52
F   <= 49

Write a program that would do the following:
• Print a suitable heading and prompt for the required information.
• Calculate the necessary required information and store in an Array(s).
• After entering the names of fifteen (15) students the program will stop prompting for additional students and calculate the required     information.
• Calculate and display grade as shown by table above.

General Guidelines:
• Make use of appropriate messages to make you program as informative and user friendly as possible, without being unnecessarily           complex.
• Keep user interactions simple and instructions clear
• Use adequate documentation and proper indentation to clarify your program code where necessary and improve layout
• Pay attention to good structure and use of programming constructs.

Evaluation

• Proper layout of interface for input, output of information 15 marks
• Use of methods to calculate percentage, grade, generate promotion message. 15 marks
• Creation and use of arrays to hold and process information 30 marks
• Correct use of basic control structures (Sequence, Selection, Repetition) 15 marks
• Working Program (Correctness, efficiency, user interaction) 15 marks
